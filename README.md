# Customizable options:

In the programs current form it was not designed to be customizable to the beginner user
If you have python experience you are more than welcome to copy and alter my program to fit your needs better / fix problems / optimize


# Why use this program?

This program targets moments of a crypto currency’s difficulty going lower than average and then proceeds to mine at these lows

This allows for less power usage, and hardware working less leading to longer longevity of your computer

With my program, your crypto mining will be much more efficient and just as easy to do as normal

# Who is this for?

This program is aimed at all who want to get into mining crypto but don’t have a dedicated mining rig

This helps in preserving hardware allowing for your computer to last longer
